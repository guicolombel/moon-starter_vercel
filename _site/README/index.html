It is not necessary to accept this invite if you wish<br>to use an<br><a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/#external-provider-login">OAuth provider</a><br>(e.g. Github) to manage authentication for your CMS.<br>It is recommended to use this method of authentication as it removes the need<br>for an email &amp; password to log in to the CMS and is generally more secure. You<br>will need to add an OAuth provider in your Netlify app settings under<br>&quot;Settings&quot; &gt; &quot;Identity&quot; &gt; &quot;External providers&quot;.</p><p>Once you've added an OAuth provider, navigate to <code>/admin</code> on your site, select your provider from the<br>list, and you should then be logged into your CMS. Cool huh?</p><p>Now you're all set, and you can start editing content!</p><h2 id="gotchas">Gotchas</h2><p>If you change the repo that was created at deploy time from public to private, you'll need to regenerate your token, as the token generated using the deploy to Netlify button can only access public repositories. To regenerate your token, head to &quot;Settings&quot; in your Netlify site dashboard, go to the &quot;Identity&quot; section, then scroll to &quot;Services&quot; where you'll see an &quot;Edit settings&quot; button. Click that and you'll see a text link to &quot;Generate access token in GitHub&quot;.</p>
